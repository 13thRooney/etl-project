# ETL

IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) data was used for this project.

Weâ€™ve isolated three CSV files from IPEDS to extrract, transform and load.

Cleaned up some messy data, joined the tables we created, loaded into a postgres relational database.

The ETL process and go-forward loaded production database may be useful for future projects.

The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System
The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), established as the core postsecondary education data collection program for NCES, is a system of surveys designed to collect data from all primary providers of postsecondary education. IPEDS is a single, comprehensive system designed to encompass all institutions and educational organizations whose primary purpose is to provide postsecondary education. The IPEDS system is built around a series of interrelated surveys to collect institution-level data in such areas as enrollments, program completions, faculty, staff, and finances.
